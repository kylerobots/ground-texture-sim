# Ground Texture Simulation
This package provides an Ignition simulation of realistic ground texture for use by monocular SLAM applications. To
promote fidelity, it uses physics based rendering (PBR) to accurately simulate the appearance of the ground texture.
Additionally, it avoids the repetition of tiles common in most simulated floors.
