# Ground Texture Simulation #

[![Open in Visual Studio Code](https://open.vscode.dev/badges/open-in-vscode.svg)](https://open.vscode.dev/kylerobots/ground-texture-sim)

This package helps create realistic ground texture synthetic images for use by a monocular SLAM application. To promote
fidelity, it uses physics based rendering (PBR) to accurately simulate the appearance of the ground texture.
Additionally, it avoids the repetition of tiles common in most simulated floors.
